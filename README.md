**Introduction**

In an era where data-driven decision-making is paramount, understanding the dynamics of legal metrics such as indictments, processes, and victim counts can significantly enhance the effectiveness of judicial systems. This report presents a comprehensive analysis of these metrics, focusing on their central tendency, dispersion, and overall distribution across different time periods and municipalities. Initial findings reveal a complex landscape where the average numbers of processes consistently exceed those of both indictments and victims, suggesting varied activities and priorities within different legal jurisdictions over the years. This introductory analysis sets the stage for a deeper exploration into what drives these variations in legal metrics and how they might reflect broader societal, political, and economic changes. The ultimate goal is to provide stakeholders with insights that can drive policy improvements and enhance the operational efficiency of the legal system.
